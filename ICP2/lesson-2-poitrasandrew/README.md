Write brief explanation here:
First i had to follow the instructions to set up wordcount.java and wordcount.jar along with getting the sample.txt loaded into hdfs.
Next, I ran the wordcount.java on sample.txt and then checked the output to make sure that it worked properly, which it did!
In order to do part two of the ICP, I needed to open WordCount.java in eclipse and adjust one line in there to make the program only map words that start with 'a'.
After making that change, I ran wordcount on sample.txt again and checked the output to make sure that it worked and it did!
